shodan == html:"Charging station interface"

~1700 hosts

default password on web interface and ssh on 60-70% from my scan

operator:yellow_zone
manufacturer:orange_zone (<- this is also the root password for ssh Oo)

most the time the ssh service is exposed on port 23.

interesting url :

/operator
/manufacturer
/dev (couldn't find the password for this)
